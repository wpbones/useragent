## Installation

You can install third party packages by using:

    $ php bones require wpbones/useragent
   
I advise to use this command instead of `composer require` because doing this an automatic renaming will done.  

You can use composer to install this package:

    $ composer require wpbones/useragent

You may also to add `"wpbones/useragent": "^1.0"` in the `composer.json` file of your plugin:
 
```json
  "require": {
    "php": ">=7.2",
    "wpbones/wpbones": "~0.8",
    "wpbones/useragent": "~1.0"
  },
```


and run 

    $ composer install
